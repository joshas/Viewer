# Viewer
[fman](https://fman.io) plugin for viewing files and images.

Currently this plugin is in an experimental state, so please do not send pull requests. Of course you can fork the code
and modify it however you want. Just be aware that current implementation has some major issues.

## Issues
- closing main app does not close Viewer window
- opening big files will freeze fman and eat all your RAM

## Usage
### In fman main view
* <kbd>F3</kbd> - view single file under cursor

### In viewer window
* <kbd>W</kbd> - toggle word wrapping

## Installation
Download and extract it to fman Plugins directory. Restart fman.
